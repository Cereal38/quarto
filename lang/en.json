  "about": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Quarto is a board game recently invented by Blaise Muller (<a href='mailto:blaise.muller@9online.fr'>blaise.muller@9online.fr</a>) and published by Gigamic.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>This is a game for two players. The board has 16 squares (4x4), and the 16 different pieces can be constructed by combining the following four characteristics:</p><ul><li>Size (big/small)</li><li>Colour (red/blue)</li><li>Shape (circle/square)</li><li>Hole (piece with hole/piece without hole)</li></ul><h2>Objective</h2><p>The aim of the game is to complete a line with four pieces that share at least one common characteristic (e.g., four big pieces, four red pieces, four circle pieces). The line can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. The player who places the fourth piece of a line wins the game.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Players take turns placing pieces on the board. Once placed, pieces cannot be moved.</p><p>After a player makes a move, the opponent chooses the next piece to be played.</p><h2>How the game goes on</h2><p>Players move alternatively, placing one piece on the board; once inserted, pieces cannot be moved.</p><p>One of the more special characteristics of this game is that the choice of the piece to be placed on the board is not made by the same player who places it; it is the opponent who, after doing his move, decides which will be the next piece to place.</p><p>So, each turn consists of two actions:</p><ol><li>Place on the board the piece given by the opponent.</li><li>Give to the opponent the piece to be placed in the next move.</li></ol><p>In the first turn of the game, the player who starts has only to choose one piece for the opponent.</p><h2>Ending</h2><p>The game ends in a draw if neither player completes a winning line after placing all 16 pieces.</p>",
